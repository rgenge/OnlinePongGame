## This is a simple Online Pong Game Interface

    It will work with sockets and can connect two players locally, with a few adjustments it can be used for online gaming.

    To run it simply run docker-compose up

    Connect through local machines and it will handle multiple players

    You may have to use different browser because you have different sockets connections

It is only the game of the big Transcendence project from 42 which is much more complex.
